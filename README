krex: kyle's robot experimentation platform

See the docs at https://krex.wntrmute.net/.

There is a Docker container for building this; note that running the
nodes in it is like to result in a number of failed nodes on account of
needing specific hardware.

To build the Docker image:
	./docker/run-container build

To run a container:
	./docker/run-container [args]

The default Docker behaviour is to run a build and exit.
